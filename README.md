# VSCode Theme Boring

A light theme with very few colors, on the border of boring.

* <span style="color: #1F1F1E; font-weight: bold;">Important words</span>, such as types and function names are bold everything
  else is normal - nothing is italic.
* Strings are <span style="color: #4F1091">purple</span>
* Comments are <span style="color: #BD689B">pink-ish</span>
* Current line is <span style="color: #E6E6E6">gray</span>
* Errors are <span style="color: #EA2446">red</span>

## Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to open an issue if you experience some strange behaviour.

If possible, include a screenshot and example code in your issue. If you
want to walk the extra mile - fire up the TextMate inspector
**Developer: Inspect TM Scopes** from the _Command Palette_ and
jot down the _"scope"_  in the GitHub issue as well.

If you want to add support for a new language, I will be happy to receive
Pull Requests - but please do not add any colors or make anything _italic_.
